Sales reporting helps to take the guesswork out of the business decisions by giving a clear view of where the company stands at every level of the sales process. By focusing on measurable activities that have clear outcomes, we can add more value to each individual sales and the company as a whole.

This dataset explores the sample financial data for an organization. This workbook has a table of sales and profit data sorted by market segment and country.

The sample data is collected from Microsoft website ([Sample Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download)) in Excel format.
The dataset can be found [here:](https://github.com/KiranPatel04/Financial-DA/blob/main/Financial%20Sample.xlsx)

### Overall Metrics:
* The total Cost of goods sold (COGS) is 101M and it refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good.
* The organization has a total of 127M gross sale which is the grand total of sale transactions within a certain time period for a company and 16M Profit in Sales.


### 1. Sales Report:

* We can choose the Country, product and segment for each country to see the total sales.
* A sales report is important because it allows the team, company managers and executives to assess how well their products or services are doing. 
* It helps them make better decisions in the future and steer away from potential problems.

### 2. Profit and Loss Report ( P&L report): 
We can see the profit by creating filters on product, segment and country.

* The goal of a Profit and Loss report is to measure the profits by excluding the expenses from the income and provide an overview of the financial health of the business. 
* It details the ability of a business to manage its business in a particular country and allows  to investigate revenue and expense trends, cash flow, net income and overall profitability – to then allocate resources and budgets accordingly.
* Another reason to generate a profit and loss report is because it’s required by the IRS to assess taxes on the business profits.

### 3. Sales by Products report:
Product Report tells us how many sales and how much revenue each specific product is generating during any time period. Select options from Filter to set filter fields for the report and Update the output with any new changes.

## Output
We have drawn many interesting inferences from our analysis; here’s a summary of the few of them:
* The most profitable segment is Government sector with the highest profits and the Enterprise segment is the least profitable.
* Out of all the countries: Canada has the highest profit and Mexico has the least.
* The product "Paseo" has the highest sales in all the countries and "Carretera" has the lowest.
* December of 2014 saw the highest profit so far. Overall between 2013 and 2014, October has consistently showed highes profits. 
* The above observation is consistent with the Sales report as well where October and December have the highest sales.
